            <p>
                Jade and Lucy are two hard-working, hard-playing women who love to laugh as much as they love to hustle. They realized two things: the world needed some help with R&R, and there simply aren't enough sweet treats for alternative diets. So, they turned their culinary hobbies into a career.<br><br>
                
                Starting from their kitchens only a year and half ago, they started a baked goods delivery service that brought sweets to everyone from tired moms to hungry coorperate parties. Now, as they finally get their brick and mortor place, they aspire to bring the simplicity of self appreciation and care to the local area!
