                <dt>Cupcakes</dt>
                <dd>Cupcakes. You know 'em. You love 'em. Our cupcakes (like everything we make)is baked with all natural ingredients. We have 5 every flavors and 5 rotating flavors that we change up daily. So call us! We're sure to have something you like!</dd>

                <dt>Cookies</dt>
                <dd>Nothing quite like a cookie, right? Crisp on the outside, a little chewy on the inside. Our cookies are delivered much like pizzas, so by the time they get to you they're still at that perfect, just cooled out of the oven consistency!</dd>

                <dt>Dounuts</dt>
                <dd>Hard to get a dounut in the evening, huh? We hear you- that's why we make and deliver dounuts daily. We stick to three flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and powdered jelly filled. And you can't forget the sprinkles! If you want 'em, we'll add 'em!</dd>

                <dt>Cheesecake of the Day</dt>
                <dd>One of our fantastic founders, Judy, is obsessed with cheesecake. The lady has a cheesecake purse for crying out loud! So you know we create our daily cheesecake with extra care, because she's probably coming in to grab a slice, too. We change it up every day and love to get creative, so check out our ordering menu to see what the flavor is for today!</dd>
